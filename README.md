Soon there will be a tutorial available on how to build your own soma bit!

For now we are making one tutorial that guides you through step by step on how to build a Soma Vibe Bit (Haptic Actuator).
Later on we will add more Soma Bits that integrate heatpads, inflatables, peltier elements and MIDI capabilities.

We wrote a research paper about it. If you'd like to have a bit more background and reasoning about it, have a look: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3533510
