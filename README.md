### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Soon there will be a tutorial on how to build your own soma bit.

For now we are making a tutorial for a Soma Vibe Bit (Haptic Actuator).
Later on we will add a Soma Bit that integrates heatpads, inflatables, peltier elements and later MIDI capabilities.

We wrote a research paper about it. If you'd like to have a bit more background and reasoning about it: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3533510
